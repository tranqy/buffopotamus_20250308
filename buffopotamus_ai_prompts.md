## Environment Design Prompts

### Borderland Setting
```
A dramatic landscape showing the borderlands between vast grasslands and a river delta. On one side, golden savanna grasses stretch toward the horizon with scattered acacia trees. On the other side, a wide river with lush wetlands, reeds, and water plants. The transition zone between these environments shows a gradual blend of both ecosystems. The scene is captured during the golden hour with warm sunlight casting long shadows and highlighting the contrast between dry and wet environments. A few distant animal silhouettes can be seen in both territories. Photorealistic landscape photography style with rich environmental details and atmospheric perspective.
```

### Buffalo Territory
```
An expansive grassland savanna habitat typical for Cape buffaloes. Golden-brown grasses stretch toward the horizon, with scattered acacia trees providing occasional shade. The earth is dusty with earthy tones, and the sky is vast and blue with a few scattered clouds. In the background, a small herd of buffaloes can be seen grazing. The scene captures the sense of wide-open spaces and the dry, warm environment of the grasslands. The lighting is bright and clear, emphasizing the openness of the landscape. Photorealistic nature photography style with attention to the textures of the grasses and earth.
```

### Hippopotamus Territory
```
A lush river environment typical for hippopotamuses. A wide, slow-moving river with rich blue-green waters flows through the scene, with muddy banks and small pools along the edges. Reeds, water lilies, and other aquatic plants grow abundantly. Several hippopotamuses can be seen partially submerged in the water, with just their eyes, ears, and nostrils visible above the surface. The surrounding vegetation is green and vibrant, creating a cool, sheltered atmosphere. Dappled sunlight filters through overhanging trees, creating patterns on the water surface. Photorealistic nature photography style with attention to the reflections on the water and the textures of the muddy banks.
```

### Biff's Unique Home
```
A unique habitat in the borderlands between grassland and river delta, showing the home territory of Biff the Buffopotamus. The area features elements of both environments: a gentle slope leads from dry grassland down to a wide, shallow section of river with a muddy bank. There's a large, comfortable wallow near the water's edge, surrounded by both savanna grasses and water plants. A few trees provide shade, and there are clear paths between the water and grazing areas. Small adaptations are visible that make the space suitable for a creature comfortable in both environments: reinforced river banks for easy access, flattened resting areas in both wet and dry zones. The scene is peaceful and harmonious, showing the successful integration of two different habitats. Photorealistic style with warm, inviting lighting that suggests this is a safe, welcoming space.

## Story Illustration Prompts

### Act 1: Rejection Scene
```
A sad Buffopotamus (buffalo-hippopotamus hybrid) standing alone at the border between grassland and river. On one side, a herd of buffaloes is moving away from him, with some looking back with suspicious expressions. On the other side, a pod of hippopotamuses in the water are similarly distancing themselves, with wary looks. The Buffopotamus stands in the middle ground, looking downcast with a posture that conveys rejection and loneliness. The scene takes place during a drought, with visibly dry conditions: low water levels, parched earth, and withered vegetation.

Between these two crises, a Buffopotamus (buffalo-hippopotamus hybrid) is shown having just realized the danger, with an expression of determination and purpose. The scene is dynamic and tense, with churning waters, heavy rain, and dark storm clouds.

A peaceful scene showing a thriving community in the borderlands between grassland and river. At the center is a Buffopotamus (buffalo-hippopotamus hybrid) standing proudly. Around him, buffaloes and hippopotamuses are mingling comfortably, no longer separated. Other animals that appear to be unique or different in some way have joined this diverse community. The environment shows signs of intentional adaptation: paths between water and land, shared grazing areas, and protective features that benefit all species. The scene is bathed in the golden light of sunrise, symbolizing a new beginning and harmony. The Buffopotamus looks confident and at peace, having found his purpose as a bridge between worlds. Photorealistic style with warm, hopeful lighting and attention to the details of community interaction and environmental adaptation.
