# Act 3: Crisis and Purpose

After months of exploration and self-discovery, Biff found himself drawn back toward the borderlands of his birth. Although he had no desire to rejoin communities that had rejected him, something pulled him homeward—perhaps a curiosity to see the places of his youth through his new perspective.

As he approached the familiar territory where grasslands met the river delta, Biff noticed something alarming. The drought that had gripped the region when he left had given way to its opposite extreme: torrential rains had caused massive flooding.

The landscape had transformed dramatically. Areas that had once been dry grasslands were now submerged under rising waters. The river had swollen to many times its normal size, breaking its banks and creating dangerous currents.

Biff's sharp eyes quickly spotted two unfolding disasters. The buffalo herd, led by Bruno, had retreated to a shrinking island of high ground as floodwaters continued to rise around them. Many of the buffaloes, especially the young calves, were panicking as their safe ground diminished by the hour.

Simultaneously, downstream, the hippopotamus pod had been caught in a strong current that was pushing them toward dangerous rapids. Even the powerful hippopotamuses were struggling against the rushing water, and Hilda, now visibly aged, was falling behind the others.

> "Both groups are in danger," Biff realized, his heart racing. "And neither can help the other—but perhaps I can help them both."

In that moment of crisis, Biff understood why he had been drawn back to the borderlands. His unique nature—part buffalo, part hippopotamus—made him perfectly equipped to address this dual emergency in a way no other creature could.

Without hesitation, Biff plunged into the floodwaters, swimming powerfully toward the stranded buffalo herd. As he approached, he saw recognition dawn in Bruno's eyes, followed by shame as he remembered how he had sent Biff away.

"The water is still rising," Biff called out above the sound of rain and rushing water. "You need to reach higher ground beyond the flood plain, but you'll have to cross deep water to get there."

Bruno lowered his massive head. "We cannot swim well enough for such a crossing, especially the calves. That's why we're trapped here."

Biff nodded, then positioned himself at the edge of the diminishing island. "I can guide you through. The calves can ride on my back while I swim, and the adults can follow in my path where the current is less strong."

Though initially hesitant, desperation drove the herd to accept Biff's help. The youngest calves were placed on his broad back, and he led the way through the floodwaters, his hippopotamus adaptations allowing him to navigate the currents with confidence while his buffalo strength kept him steady with the added weight.

After multiple trips, the entire herd reached safety on higher ground. But Biff's work wasn't done. Without pausing to accept their gratitude, he dove back into the water and swam downstream with powerful strokes toward the hippopotamus pod struggling against the current.

Using his buffalo stamina and land-adapted lungs, Biff was able to swim tirelessly against the current that was exhausting even the strongest hippopotamuses. He reached Hilda first, positioning himself to break the current for her.

"Biff?" she gasped in recognition. "Why would you help us after we turned you away?"

"Because I can," Biff answered simply, using his stronger legs to brace against the riverbed and his horns to divert the rushing water.

Working systematically, Biff helped each hippopotamus fight the current and reach a calm eddy away from the deadly rapids. His unique combination of hippopotamus swimming ability and buffalo strength made him the perfect rescuer for this crisis.

As the rain finally began to ease, Biff stood at the borderland between the rescued buffalo herd and hippopotamus pod, no longer an outcast but a hero whose unique nature had saved both communities.
