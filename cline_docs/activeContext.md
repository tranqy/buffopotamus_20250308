# Active Development Context

## Current Project: Buffopotamus Website

I am currently working on building a creative storytelling website for a fictional creature called the Buffopotamus, a hybrid between a buffalo and a hippopotamus. The website showcases this unique creature through an interactive story, information about its characteristics, and eventually a gallery and facts section.

## Current Implementation Status

The project is being built using Astro 5, a modern static site generator with excellent content management capabilities. The site is structured around content collections for story chapters, facts, and gallery items.

I've completed:
- Base site structure with responsive layout and navigation
- Content collections configuration
- Global CSS styling system with design tokens
- Main story content across four acts
- Home and About pages with the core messaging
- Story page with interactive navigation through story acts
- BuffopotamusCard component for displaying information
- Integration of newly added images across the website
- Added image directories with naming conventions

## Most Recent Work

1. Updated the story page to use actual images for each story act
2. Enhanced the home page with a hero image and main Buffopotamus image
3. Improved the about page with borderland and comparison images
4. Created README files in the public image directories to document image naming conventions
5. Reorganized images to use Astro's image optimization features

## Current Challenges

- Need to create content for the facts and gallery collections
- Need to implement the remaining pages (gallery, fun facts, contact)
- Need to develop character portraits for the story character sidebar

## Next Tasks

1. Create content for the facts collection with information about habitat, physical traits, and behavior
2. Implement the gallery page with filtering functionality
3. Create a facts page that displays the facts collection content
4. Develop contact form with client-side validation
5. Enhance character sidebar with actual character portraits instead of letter placeholders
6. Add more responsive design improvements for mobile devices
