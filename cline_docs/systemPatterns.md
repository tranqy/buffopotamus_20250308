# System Patterns

## How the System is Built
The Buffopotamus website will be built as a static website with the following components:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity (if needed)

## Key Technical Decisions
- Static website approach for simplicity and ease of deployment
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices
- Modular structure to separate content, styling, and functionality
- Image optimization for performance

## Architecture Patterns
- Content-first approach with semantic HTML
- Progressive enhancement for JavaScript functionality
- Component-based design for reusable UI elements
- Mobile-first responsive design

Note: These patterns are initial recommendations and may evolve as the project progresses.
