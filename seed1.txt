We're going to create a site for a buffopotamus, a cross between a buffalo and a hippopotamus. 

You're going to create specs first that we'll use to implement later. 

We're going to be creating a site, writing a story, and generating images. If I need to run prompts in another ai service to complete the project that's ok.
