## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| AI image generation quality issues | Medium | High | Prepare multiple prompt variations, be ready to iterate, have backup plan for critical images |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Use progressive enhancement, test early and often, focus on standard features |
| Content delays | Low | High | Use placeholders, develop with sample content, separate content from presentation |
| Performance issues with many images | Medium | Medium | Implement lazy loading, optimize image sizes, use appropriate formats (WebP) |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Clearly document requirements, use change control process, prioritize features |

## Success Criteria

1. All pages render correctly across target devices and browsers
2. Story content is complete and properly integrated
3. All Buffopotamus images are generated and optimized
4. Interactive elements function as specified
5. The site meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
6. Page load performance meets targets (< 3s initial load)
7. All specified features from the requirements are implemented

## Maintenance Plan
